# Check specs

This project contains the check-specs tool that used to be part of
[Reffy](https://github.com/w3c/reffy). The tool takes a spec or a list of specs
as input, along with a link to a reference crawl report, and run Reffy and
Strudy in turn on the provided specs to create an anomaly report for them that
takes the reference crawl report into account.
